# Multi-Timezone-Clock
Developed an advanced Multi-Timezone Clock application featuring real-time display of multiple time zones
with ASCII clock representations. Implemented a user-friendly menu system allowing dynamic addition and
removal of custom time zones. Utilized Java's time API (java.time) for accurate time management and
Zone-Id for flexible timezone handling.
